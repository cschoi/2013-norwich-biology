Session 4: data analysis in IPython Notebook
============================================

.. http://2013-caltech-workshop.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_static/lecture5-pipelines.pdf

Copy ``rsem-final`` out of the biology bootcamp shared directory
into your home directory ('Home').

At the command line, now do ::

   cd ~/rsem-final && ipython notebook --pylab=inline

We'll work through a new notebook first, and then go through 'rsem-ebseq'.

Additional IPython resources:

* The ipynb site: http://ipython.org/notebook.html
* A gallery of interesting notebooks: https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks
* The matplotlib gallery: http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html

Note that you can use '%loadpy' in IPython Notebook to grab code from online
and import it into your notebook automagically.
